# snu-snu
A tool for 'training' the recommendation system used by the online retail giant Amazon. This package is not also partly useable via the web application http://rars.online.

##### Basic use

install the package:

         pip install git+https://github.com/simoncrowe/snusnu.git
         
Run your python interpreter. i.e.

         python3
         
Use the basic terminal interface

         from snusnu import terminal

##### The tool is currently under development. It now emcompasses most of the following functionality although some is still incomplete:
1. Automate the process of searching and viewing products, and adding them to lists.
    1. Through interactive command line interface.
    1. Through JSON list of ProductCommand objects.
    1. When installed as a package, through function calls in other scripts.
1. Generate JSON lists of ProductCommand objects based on NLP of arbitrary texts. *note* this functionality has been moved to https://github.com/nlp-frequency-analysis-snusnu
1. Serialise recommended products from all sources for later analysis.

##### Dependancies:
- Selenium and ChromeDriver
- Requests
- Pillow
